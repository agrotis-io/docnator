## Pull request roadmap
Step by step, with all the way to get an issue, organize the development environment, solve the problem and submit to your pull request.

### Catch the task on the Project
Take a task in the [project](https://github.com/agrotis-io/star-t/projects/1), read the content of issue, if you have any questions, leave a comment.

### Clone/Fork the Project
Members must be clone the project and submit a pull request, other contributors must be fork the project.

### Branch Organization
Our branches must be created using the name suggested in the description of the issue, which should only be sent to the remote repository. The branch names follow the rule: issue_ [number_of_issue] - [title_of_issue].

> ex: issue_3-update_contributing

### Develop workflow
After cloning the project and creating the branch, follow [README.md](https://github.com/agrotis-io/star-t/blob/master/README.md) to configure your environment. Develop your solution and write your tests (if necessary), when your task is finished, send it to pull request.

## lint
We have used the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) ccode formatter, if you want to configure your editor to work with it, see [integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

## jsdocs
Eont forget the write documentation of your features, [use JsDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/)

## test
We are using [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)as the unit testing plataform. Write the unit tests, each assert must be isolated for the others features or others asserts. The test messages title should follow this rule: “module_name - feature_name - test_name”.

> ex: "FileReader.mountFilesList - must return list.length equals 3"
